# R Guitar Fourths Tuning Project Rules

## String Numbering

- Always use tabr's expected format where strings are numbered 6 to 1
- 6 = lowest string (E)
- 1 = highest string (F)
- Define string positions directly in 6:1 format
- DO NOT convert between formats - use 6:1 format throughout the code
- Example: string_positions <- c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) for all strings

## Fret Positions

- Fret positions start at 0 (open string)
- Use NA to indicate muted strings
- Maximum fret position is 25
- Fret positions cannot be negative

## Scale Definitions

- Define fret positions for each string separately
- Use descriptive variable names: string_X_frets where X is the string number
- Include comments indicating which string is which (e.g., # Low E string)
- Group related notes with comments (e.g., # Root notes)

## Plotting

- Use black for regular notes, and white for labels
- Use white for root notes, and black for root note labels
- Include fret markers at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12
- Always show tuning information
- Use horizontal orientation for fretboard

## File Organization

- Keep scale definitions in guitar_scale.R
- Keep plotting functions in utils_plot.R
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate content
- Save plots to the plots/ directory

## Code Style

- Use meaningful variable names
- Include comments for complex calculations
- Group related operations together
- Validate inputs in functions
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Keep lines under 80 characters when possible
